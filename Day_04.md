Certainly! The `terraform init` command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. Here are some common and useful options and commands that you can use with `terraform init`:

1. **-backend-config=CONFIGFILE**: Specifies a backend configuration file. This is useful when you want to use a backend configuration file instead of interactive prompts.

    ```bash
    terraform init -backend-config=mybackend.config
    ```

2. **-input=true/false**: When set to `false`, Terraform will not ask for input for variables if not directly set.

    ```bash
    terraform init -input=false
    ```

3. **-lock=true/false**: This option is used to enable or disable state file locking during state operations.

    ```bash
    terraform init -lock=true
    ```

4. **-get-plugins=true/false**: Forces the automatic installation of plugins.

    ```bash
    terraform init -get-plugins=true
    ```

5. **-upgrade=true/false**: Use this flag to automatically upgrade modules and plugins to newer versions if available.

    ```bash
    terraform init -upgrade=true
    ```

6. **-verify-plugins=true/false**: If set to `true`, Terraform will verify the plugin signatures during initialization.

    ```bash
    terraform init -verify-plugins=true
    ```

7. **-reconfigure**: This flag is used to force reconfiguration of already-initialized providers.

    ```bash
    terraform init -reconfigure
    ```

8. **-backend=true/false**: When set to `false`, the initialization process won't configure the backend.

    ```bash
    terraform init -backend=false
    ```

These are just a few examples, and there are many more options and configurations available. You can always check the [official Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) for the most up-to-date information on the `terraform init` command and its options.
